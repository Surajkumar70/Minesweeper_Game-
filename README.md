# Minesweeper_Game
Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle computer game. The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" or bombs without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field. The game originates from the 1960s, and has been written for many computing platforms in use today. It has many variations and off shoots.

# Technologies Used
The good old Three Amigos:

# HTML
# CSS
# JavaScript

# HTML
As you can see from the source code, the HTML is very concise, as most of the action happens in the JavaScript. Not to mention, the gameboard itself is just a simple table.

# CSS
I had a lot of fun styling this to the old look of the Windows '95 desktop view. I still want to mess around with it a bit to get it perrrrfect (couldn't find the exact font used by MS).

My biggest challenge with the CSS was figuring out the table styles (borders, td sizes, etc.)

# JavaScript
As this was my first time ever writing a functioning web app using JavaScript, it's not a big surprise that this section was by far the greatest challenge of the project for me.
